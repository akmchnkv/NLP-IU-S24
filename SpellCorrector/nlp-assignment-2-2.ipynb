The idea is to compute conditional probabilities of possible correction options. For example, the phrase \"dking sport\" should be fixed as \"doing sport\" not \"dying sport\", while \"dking species\" -- as \"dying species\".\n\nThe best way to start is to analyze [Norvig's solution](https://norvig.com/spell-correct.html) and [N-gram Language Models](https://web.stanford.edu/~jurafsky/slp3/3.pdf).\n\nYou may also want to implement:\n- spell-checking for a concrete language - Russian, Tatar, etc. - any one you know, such that the solution accounts for language specifics,\n- some recent (or not very recent) paper on this topic,\n- solution which takes into account keyboard layout and associated misspellings,\n- efficiency improvement to make the solution faster,\n- any other idea of yours to improve the Norvig’s solution.\n\nIMPORTANT:  \nYour project should not be a mere code copy-paste from somewhere.

My method dynamically slices 5-grams to generate 3 and 4-grams, providing a more comprehensive understanding of language patterns without needing separately maintained datasets. This improves performance and scalability.\n\n## Enhanced Decision Making\n\n#### Key Improvement\nPrioritization of corrections based on context length and frequency.\n\n#### Justification\nMy solution evaluates candidate words based on their context length and occurrence, ensuring that chosen corrections are not only probable but also contextually coherent. This addresses the issue of correct words feeling \"out of place,\" a limitation in Norvig's simpler probability-based selection.\n\n## Flexible Correction Approach\n\n#### Key Improvement\nCorrection suggestions for known words based on edit distance and context.\n\n#### Justification\nNorvig's corrector accepts a known word as is, without considering potential contextual misfits. MY approach generates one-edit distance candidates even for known words, introducing flexibility and enabling the system to suggest alternatives that might better fit the context.","metadata":{"id":"6Xb_twOmVsC6"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Evaluate on a test set","metadata":{"id":"46rk65S4GRSe"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"from tqdm import tqdm\n\ndef

Instead of suggesting corrections based solely on their similarity to the incorrect word, the corrector considers how well the suggestions fit within the sentence's broader context.\n\n2. **Dynamic Data Utilization**: The Context Sensitive Corrector dynamically generates 3 and 4-grams from a 5-gram dataset.\n\n3. **Enhanced Decision Making**: The Context Sensitive Corrector evaluates potential corrections based on their context length and frequency, ensuring that suggested corrections are not only probable but also contextually coherent. \n\n4. **Flexible Correction Approach**: The Context Sensitive Corrector offers correction suggestions for both misspelled and known words based on edit distance and context. Instead of accepting a known word as correct without considering the context, the Context Sensitive Corrector system takes both factors into account. \n\n","metadata":{}}]}
